### Getting Started

To set up your development environment:

```bash
make init
````

This will:

* Create a virtual environment in `.venv/`
* Install all Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`

To activate the environment manually:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.venv\\Scripts\\activate   # Windows (CMD)
```

## Course Modules

### 1. Data Science Foundations (`DataScience/`)

* Linear Algebra for Data Science
* Python and Pandas for Data Manipulation
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

### 2. Machine Learning (`ML/`)

* Introduction to ML (Classification, Regression, Clustering)
* Pipelines and Model Evaluation
* Decision Trees, Random Forests, Ensembles
* Deep Learning with MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
* Model Deployment & Serving

### 3. Workflow Orchestration (`Airflow/`)

* DAGs, Operators, Scheduling, Monitoring
* Airflow + Docker setup
* Building robust and modular data pipelines

---

## ✅ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Recommended: VSCode or JupyterLab
* Docker (for Airflow module)

---

## Practice and Exercises

Each notebook contains embedded exercises to reinforce learning:

* Try variations of the models
* Tune hyperparameters
* Implement additional visualizations
* Train models on alternate datasets
